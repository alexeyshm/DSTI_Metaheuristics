## Metaheuristics

### Shifted Rastrigin's Function

Function has many local minimas, so it will be hard to optimize it using simlex or gradiend-based methods.
We will use Genetic Algorythm from jMetalPy library.
The method is described here:
https://github.com/jMetal/jMetalPy/blob/master/examples/singleobjective/genetic_algorithm/generational_genetic_algorithm_float.py 

We will adapt it to optimizing the shifted version of Rastrigin's function.
